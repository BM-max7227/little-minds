    question: "How do I know when to get help?",
    answer:
      "Consider getting professional help when symptoms persist for more than a few weeks, interfere with daily activities like school or friendships, cause significant distress, or if your child expresses thoughts of self-harm. Trust your instincts—if you're concerned, it's worth reaching out to a professional.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my child won't talk?",
    answer:
      "It's common for kids and teens to be reluctant to talk. Try different approaches: ask while doing an activity together, write a note, or have conversations in the car where eye contact isn't required. Let them know you're available whenever they're ready, without pressure. Sometimes talking to someone else first (counselor, trusted adult) can help them open up.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I tried and it didn't work yet?",
    answer:
      "Change takes time. If one approach didn't work, it doesn't mean nothing will. Try adjusting your strategy: different timing, different person, different activity. Consider whether your child needs more time, different support, or a different type of help. Persistence and patience, combined with professional guidance, often lead to progress.",

    question: "What can a school counselor do?",
    answer:
      "School counselors can provide immediate support during the school day, help with academic planning, teach coping skills, mediate peer conflicts, and connect families to community resources. They can also monitor your child's wellbeing and coordinate with teachers to support their needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a therapist and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "A therapist is a trained mental health professional who provides a safe, confidential space for your child to talk about their feelings and challenges. Sessions typically last 45-60 minutes and happen weekly or biweekly. Therapists use evidence-based techniques to teach coping skills, process emotions, and work toward specific goals.",

  {
    question: "How do I talk about online time?",
    answer:
      "Approach online time with curiosity rather than judgment. Ask what they enjoy about it, who they connect with, and how it makes them feel. Set clear boundaries together about when and where devices are used, and model healthy tech habits yourself. Focus on balance rather than bans.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if cost is a barrier?",
    answer:
      "Many options exist for affordable mental health care: school counselors are free, community mental health centers offer sliding scale fees, some therapists offer reduced rates, and university training clinics provide low-cost services. Your insurance may cover more than you think—call to ask about children's mental health benefits.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I look after myself as a parent?",
    answer:
      "Supporting a struggling child is emotionally demanding. Prioritize your own basics: sleep, nutrition, movement, and connection. Take breaks when you can. Talk to other parents or a therapist yourself. Remember that taking care of yourself isn't selfish—it gives you the energy and patience to be there for your child.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I use these tools?",
    answer:
      "Start with one tool that feels most relevant to your situation. Try it consistently for a week or two before deciding if it helps. Tools work best when paired with open communication and professional support when needed. It's okay if not every tool works for your family—use what fits.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I call emergency services?",
    answer:
      "Call emergency services immediately if your child is in immediate danger, has harmed themselves, expresses intent to harm themselves or others, or is experiencing a mental health crisis where they cannot be kept safe at home. This is not an overreaction—it's appropriate and necessary care.",
